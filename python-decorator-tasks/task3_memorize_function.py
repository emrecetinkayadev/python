# ### Task 3

# Write a decorator to memoize functions with an arbitrary set of arguments. 
# Note that memoization is only possible if the arguments are hashable. 
# If the wrapper is called with arguments which are not hashable, 
# then the argument should be converted or the wrapped function should just be called without caching.  
# Investigate the variation of usage.
